# Midweek Project: Car Prices
Given a dataset and a data dictionary, you will perform a linear regression analysis that predicts the price of cars. The paper needs to be written in APA format and needs to be a minimum of 2 pages. Upload your markdown file as well. Any images that you want to use should be referenced in the appendix. Include responses to the following questions in your submission:

1) What were the three most significant variables?
2) Of those three, which had the greatest positive influence on car prices?
3) How accurate was the model?

# Final Project: Building the Car of the Future
A car manufacturer known for making large automobiles is struggling with sales and has asked for your help in designing an energy efficient car. Using data gathered, determine which attributes may contribute to higher gas mileage so that they can design a more fuel efficient automobile.

Part 1: Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.

Part 2: Build a linear regression model to accurately predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on the attributes of a vehicle. Discuss the significant attributes and how they can help you build the proper car.

Part 3: Optimize the model using selection techniques, explain whether the model can achieve the specified goals, and describe which attributes contribute to higher MPG over others.
