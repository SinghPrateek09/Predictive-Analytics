# Midweek Project: Loan Approval
Your bank has gotten a list of loans and don’t have time to approve or reject them tomorrow. You decided to use logistic regression analysis to help you make that decision. Perform the analysis and also be ready to answer the following three questions to your boss tomorrow morning. The paper needs to be written in APA format and needs to be a minimum of 2 pages. Upload your markdown file as well. Any images that you want to use should be referenced in the appendix. Include responses to the following questions in your submission:
1) What were the three most significant variables?
2) Of those three, which had the most negative influence on loan acceptance?
3) How accurate was the model overall and what was the precision rate?

# Final Project: Understanding Magazine Subscription Behavior
A magazine company is trying to understand last year’s decline in subscriptions. With people spending more time at home, they thought people would be spending more time reading. Using this dataset, help the company understand what is or isn’t working.

Part 1: Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.

Part 2: Build a logistic model to accurately predict subscription behavior. Discuss which variables are significant, their business impact, and how that may help you learn about the business.

Part 3: Build an SVM model to accurately predict subscription behavior. Discuss which variables are significant, their business impact, and how that may help you learn about the business.

Part 4: Compare the accuracy of both models (overall accuracy, precision, recall) and the overall variables that were deemed significant. Discuss which model you would recommend based upon these three metrics.
