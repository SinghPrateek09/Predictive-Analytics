# Final Project : Investing in Nashville
You just started working for a real estate company and they are looking to make a huge investment into the growing Nashville area. Theyâ€™ve acquired a dataset about recent sales and want you to build a model to help them accurately find the best value deals when they go to visit next week.
Part 1: Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.
Part 2: Build a linear regression model to accurately predict housing prices and determine what is driving those prices.
Part 3: Build a decision tree model and compare the results with the results of the previous model.
Part 4: Build a Random Forest model and compare the results with the results of the previous models.
Part 5: Build a Gradient Boost model and compare the results with the results of the previous models.
Part 6: Use multiple benchmarking metrics to compare and contrast the three models. Based on your findings, provide evidence of which model you believe the real estate company should use.
