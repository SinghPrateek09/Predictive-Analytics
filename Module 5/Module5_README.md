# Final Project: Text Classification
A school is trying to decide if they can use a writing test to understand which students may need to work on their motor skills at a young age. They are testing this by having them write numbers and they want us to build a model to see if we can predict what they’ve drawn. To accomplish this, they want you to use a simplistic approach (KNN) to start the research but also compare the results with something more complicated like neural networks to accomplish this week’s task. In theory, if the model can clearly identify what a number is, that may help us point out students that need more help. Using the following dataset, complete the project.
 
Part 1: Build a KNN model to predict handwriting correctly. Discuss the accuracy that you found and some of the challenges involved with using KNN for this model.
 
Part 2: Build a neural network model to predict handwriting. Discuss the accuracy and some of the challenges that you had.
 
Part 3: Using multiple benchmarking metrics to compare and contrast both models. Summarize your findings and suggest a final model for the school to use.
